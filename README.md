We can improve the functionality further, such as by adding an email template for login. I created two APIs, but we can combine them into one
and proper validation form the both server side and clinet side like now i this scianario i click on the regiter user is created in the db but when i am try again i am not able to move on the verfity otp page becasue user is alredy created  we can make it using flag so this issue
